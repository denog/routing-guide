# Tier 1 ASNs

As a Tier 2/3 Network, you may want to filter out routes that have traversed Tier 1 ASNs at IXPs or from customers, as you probably don't want to provide transit for Tier 1 Networks or accept transit for Tier 1 Networks from your customers.

!!! danger "Caution"

    You should only apply this filter on your customers and IXP peers, not on your upstream transit providers.

Be aware that you need to manually check the prefix list as you could peer with for instance Microsoft of other parties on the list. So you need to do a quick sanity check on the AS numbers to fit your need.
